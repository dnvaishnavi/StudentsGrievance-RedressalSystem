*Problem Definition*

In many educational institutions, students face challenges in effectively raising grievances and complaints regarding academic, administrative, or infrastructure-related issues. The lack of a centralized and structured grievance redressal system often leads to delays in resolution, loss of complaint records, and lack of transparency. Students may not have a clear way to track the status of their complaints, and authorities may struggle to prioritize and categorize them for appropriate action. This gap leads to dissatisfaction, reduced trust in the administration, and an inefficient resolution process.

*Proposed Solution*

The proposed Students Grievance and Complaints Support & Re-addressal System is a centralized web-based platform that enables students to submit complaints, track their status, and receive timely updates. 

This system provides students with a platform to submit their grievances online
and track the resolution status efficiently.

Current Features:
- Grievance submission through an online form
- Tracking the status of submitted issues
- Admin/authority panel to review and resolve grievances
